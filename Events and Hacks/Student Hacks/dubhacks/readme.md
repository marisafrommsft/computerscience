## Being a mentor
**What resources do I point hackers to?** (MSFT internal only)
[aka.ms/hackwithazure](https://aka.ms/hackwithazure) is a good place to start (feel free to fork, pull request and contribute) but also, whatever **you** think is a good resource!

**How do I talk to hackers?** (MSFT internal only)
Sometimes hackers may be a little shy about approaching company reps, so feel free to walk around the hacking area and introduce yourself, ask them what they’re working on, and offer your expertise!


## Being a judge (MSFT internal only)
We're going to be judging all the projects during the expo, then only projects that used Azure for the Azure Champ Challenge. Everyone please be at the Microsoft booth at 1:30pm on Sunday during judging huddle for the lowdown.
