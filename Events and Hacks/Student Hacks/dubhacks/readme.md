## Being a mentor
**What resources do I point hackers to?**
[aka.ms/hackwithazure](https://aka.ms/hackwithazure) is a good place to start (feel free to fork, pull request and contribute) but also, whatever **you** think is a good resource!

**How do I talk to hackers?** 
Sometimes hackers may be a little shy about approaching company reps, so feel free to walk around the hacking area and introduce yourself, ask them what theyâ€™re working on, and offer your expertise!
